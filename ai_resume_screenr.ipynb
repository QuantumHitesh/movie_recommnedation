        "*   The Streamlit library and its dependencies, including `PyPDF2` for PDF text extraction and NLTK for text preprocessing, were successfully installed.\n",
        "*   The core structure of the Streamlit application was set up, including a title, introductory text, and placeholders for functionality.\n",
        "*   File upload functionality was successfully implemented using `st.file_uploader`, allowing users to upload multiple `.txt` and `.pdf` files.\n",
        "*   Resume preprocessing logic, including lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization, and stop word removal, was integrated to handle text extracted from both `.txt` and `.pdf` files.\n",
        "*   A predefined dictionary of screening criteria categorized into 'skills', 'experience', 'education', and 'keywords' was defined.\n",
        "*   Resume evaluation logic was successfully integrated, which iterates through preprocessed resumes and checks for the presence of terms defined in the screening criteria.\n",
        "*   The screening criteria were displayed within the Streamlit application using headers and markdown formatting.\n",
        "*   The screening results for each uploaded resume, showing the matched criteria per category, were successfully displayed in a user-friendly format using headers, bold text, bullet points, and horizontal rules for separation.\n",
        "*   Integration of a language model for enhanced screening was attempted but deemed infeasible within the given environment constraints.\n",
        "*   User interface enhancements were implemented by adding a main title, introductory text, clear subheaders for different sections (Screening Criteria, Processing Uploaded Files, Screening Results), and visual separators.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   To enhance the screening process, explore alternative language model integration methods (e.g., using external APIs like OpenAI or Hugging Face, or local libraries like spaCy) if environment constraints are lifted.\n",
        "*   Improve the sophistication of the evaluation logic beyond simple string matching, potentially incorporating natural language processing techniques to understand context and relevance more effectively.\n"
